# Mail Service AI Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality
All code must be clean, maintainable, and well-documented. It must adhere to established style guides and pass all automated linting checks before being merged.

### II. Testing Standards
Comprehensive testing is mandatory. All new features must be accompanied by unit tests with a minimum of 80% code coverage. Critical paths and complex logic must have integration tests. End-to-end tests should be written for user-facing features.

### III. User Experience Consistency
A consistent and intuitive user experience is paramount. All UI components and user-facing interactions must adhere to the project's design system and style guide.

### IV. Performance Requirements
The application must be performant and scalable. Key performance indicators (KPIs), such as API response times and resource utilization, must be defined, monitored, and optimized.

### V. Security
Security is a primary concern. All code must be written with security best practices in mind. All dependencies must be scanned for vulnerabilities, and all user input must be sanitized and validated.

### VI. Documentation Language
All project documentation, including this constitution, specifications, and user guides, must be written in Korean.

## Development Workflow

All code changes must be submitted as a pull request and reviewed by at least one other team member. All pull requests must pass all automated checks, including linting, testing, and security scans, before being merged.

## Governance

This constitution is the single source of truth for all development practices. Any amendments to this constitution must be proposed as a pull request and approved by the project maintainers.
