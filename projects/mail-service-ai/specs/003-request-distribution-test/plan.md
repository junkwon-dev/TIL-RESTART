# Implementation Plan: Request Distribution Test

**Branch**: `003-request-distribution-test` | **Date**: 2025-10-20 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/003-request-distribution-test/spec.md`

## Summary

This feature allows administrators to configure a ratio for distributing email requests across different service providers. It includes a test function to send 100 emails and a verification page to confirm the distribution. The backend will be built with the latest version of Spring Boot and Kotlin, following a simple layered architecture (controller-service-infrastructure). It will use an in-memory database (H2) for storage and Thymeleaf for the admin UI.

## Technical Context

-   **Language/Version**: Kotlin (with Spring Boot 3.x)
-   **Primary Dependencies**: Spring Boot, Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Thymeleaf, H2 Database, Jackson Kotlin Module
-   **Storage**: H2 (In-memory)
-   **Testing**: JUnit 5, MockK, Spring Test
-   **Target Platform**: JVM
-   **Project Type**: Web Application
-   **Architecture**: Layered Architecture (Controller -> Service -> Infrastructure/Repository)
-   **Performance Goals**: The test send of 100 emails should complete within 60 seconds. Admin UI pages should load in under 2 seconds.
-   **Constraints**: The application must be self-contained and run without external database dependencies.
-   **Scale/Scope**: This feature is for administrative purposes and is not expected to handle high-volume concurrent user traffic.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

-   **Code Quality**: The proposed solution will adhere to clean code principles and Kotlin documentation standards.
-   **Testing Standards**: The plan includes comprehensive testing (unit, integration) using MockK and Spring Test.
-   **UX Consistency**: The design will be a simple and functional admin interface, aligning with basic web standards.
-   **Performance**: Performance requirements are defined and will be measured.
-   **Security**: The admin interface will be protected by basic authentication.
-   **Documentation Language**: All generated documentation will be in Korean.

**Structure Decision**: A standard single-project Spring Boot web application structure will be used, with packages organized by layer (controller, service, infrastructure) as requested.
