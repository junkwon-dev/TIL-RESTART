# Research: Request Distribution Test

**Date**: 2025-10-20

## 1. Spring Boot and Kotlin Version

-   **Decision**: Spring Boot 3.4.x with Kotlin 2.0.x.
-   **Rationale**: This is the latest stable combination, providing up-to-date features and security patches. Spring Boot has excellent first-party support for Kotlin.
-   **Alternatives Considered**: Older versions of Spring Boot were considered but rejected to ensure access to the latest features and performance improvements.

## 2. Backend Framework and Language

-   **Decision**: Spring Boot with Kotlin.
-   **Rationale**: The user explicitly requested this stack. It offers a robust, modern, and efficient environment for building web applications. Kotlin's conciseness and safety features are a good fit for a modern codebase.
-   **Alternatives Considered**: None, as the stack was specified by the user.

## 3. Frontend Templating Engine

-   **Decision**: Thymeleaf.
-   **Rationale**: The user explicitly requested Thymeleaf. It integrates seamlessly with Spring Boot and allows for server-side rendering of HTML, which is suitable for a simple admin interface. The Thymeleaf Spring Security dialect provides easy integration with security features.
-   **Alternatives Considered**: None, as the templating engine was specified by the user.

## 4. Database

-   **Decision**: H2 In-Memory Database.
-   **Rationale**: The user requested an in-memory database. H2 is lightweight, fast, and requires no external setup, making it ideal for this project's self-contained nature and for testing purposes. The H2 console will be enabled for easy database inspection during development.
-   **Alternatives Considered**: None, as the database type was specified by the user.

## 5. Architecture

-   **Decision**: A simple layered architecture (Controller -> Service -> Infrastructure/Repository).
-   **Rationale**: The user requested a simple layered architecture. This pattern effectively separates concerns, making the application easier to understand, maintain, and test. The layers will be organized by packages within a single module.
-   **Alternatives Considered**: A full Hexagonal or Clean Architecture was considered but deemed overly complex for the current scope of the project.
